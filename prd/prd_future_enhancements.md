## 3. Reliability Improvements

### Intelligent Retry Logic

**The Problem:**
Network errors are often transient. Blindly retrying immediately wastes resources. Not retrying at all gives up too easily.

**The Solution:**
Exponential backoff with jitter:

```dart
RetryOptions(
  maxRetries: 3,
  initialDelay: Duration(seconds: 1),
  maxDelay: Duration(seconds: 30),
  backoffMultiplier: 2.0,
  jitter: true,
)
```

Retry sequence:
- Attempt 1 fails → wait 1s + jitter
- Attempt 2 fails → wait 2s + jitter
- Attempt 3 fails → wait 4s + jitter
- Attempt 4 fails → give up

Jitter prevents thundering herd when many clients retry simultaneously.

**Error Classification:**
Not all errors should retry:

Retryable:
- Network timeouts
- 5xx server errors
- Connection refused
- DNS failures

Non-retryable:
- 4xx client errors (except 429)
- 401 unauthorized
- 404 not found
- Invalid response format

Classification customizable per application.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

**The Problem:**
When backend service is down, repeatedly hitting it wastes resources and delays failure detection. Apps should fail fast.

**The Solution:**
Circuit breaker tracks failure rate. When threshold exceeded, circuit "opens" and requests fail immediately without hitting backend.

**States:**
1. **Closed:** Normal operation, requests go through
2. **Open:** Too many failures, requests fail immediately
3. **Half-Open:** Testing if backend recovered

**State Transitions:**
Closed → Open: Failure rate exceeds threshold (e.g., 50% in 1 minute)
Open → Half-Open: After cooldown period (e.g., 30 seconds)
Half-Open → Closed: Test request succeeds
Half-Open → Open: Test request fails

**Configuration:**
```dart
CircuitBreakerOptions(
  failureThreshold: 0.5,
  windowDuration: Duration(minutes: 1),
  cooldownDuration: Duration(seconds: 30),
)
```

**Per-Endpoint:**
Circuit breakers are per endpoint, not global. One failing endpoint doesn't affect others.

### Request Cancellation

**The Problem:**
User navigates away before data loads. Request completes anyway, wasting bandwidth and updating stale cache.

**The Solution:**
Robust cancellation system:

1. **Automatic Cancellation:**
   - Widget disposal cancels requests
   - Query disposal cancels requests
   - Timeout cancels requests

2. **Cancellation Propagation:**
   - Parent query cancellation cancels dependent queries
   - Mutation cancellation cancels optimistic update

3. **Resource Cleanup:**
   - Cancelled requests release network connections
   - Cancelled parsing stops immediately
   - Cancelled cache operations rollback

**Testing:**
Verify cancellation:
- Doesn't leak memory
- Doesn't corrupt cache
- Doesn't leave partial state
- Completes quickly (<100ms)

## 4. Memory Management

### Memory Pressure Handling

**The Problem:**
Low-memory devices run out of RAM. OS kills apps that consume too much. Cache can contribute to memory pressure.

**The Solution:**
Listen to platform memory warnings:

```
MemoryPressure.low → evict 25% of cache
MemoryPressure.medium → evict 50% of cache
MemoryPressure.critical → evict all non-active queries
```

Eviction prioritizes:
1. Inactive queries (no subscribers)
2. Large entries
3. Least recently used
4. Non-secure entries first

**Implementation:**
Platform-specific listeners:
- iOS: `didReceiveMemoryWarning`
- Android: `onTrimMemory`
- Web: Not applicable
- Desktop: Platform-specific

**Testing:**
Simulate memory pressure and verify:
- Cache size reduces
- App doesn't crash
- Active queries preserved
- Evicted queries refetch correctly

### Leak Prevention

**The Problem:**
Memory leaks accumulate over time. Slow leaks are hard to detect in development but catastrophic in production.

**The Solution:**
Multi-layered leak prevention:

1. **Automated Leak Detection:**
   - Tests monitor memory over time
   - Fail if memory grows unexpectedly
   - Detect leaked queries, streams, subscriptions

2. **Reference Counting:**
   - Every subscription tracked
   - Automatic cleanup when count reaches zero
   - Validation that counts never go negative

3. **Disposal Verification:**
   - Every created resource has disposal path
   - Tests verify disposal happens
   - Warnings if disposal takes too long

4. **Weak References:**
   - Use weak references where appropriate
   - Prevent circular references
   - Allow GC to reclaim memory

**Leak Testing:**
24-hour stress test:
- Create 1000 queries per minute
- Navigate between screens
- Monitor memory usage
- Verify stable memory (not growing)

---

## 5. Developer Tools

### DevTools Extension

**The Problem:**
Debugging query issues requires visibility into cache state, active queries, network requests, and state transitions.

**The Solution:**
Flutter DevTools extension showing:

1. **Query Inspector:**
   - List all active queries
   - Show query state, data, error
   - Display staleness, cache time
   - Show subscriber count

2. **Cache Visualizer:**
   - Browse cache entries
   - See entry metadata
   - Inspect cached data
   - Clear specific entries

3. **Network Activity:**
   - Timeline of requests
   - Request/response details
   - Success/error status
   - Timing information

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Cache hit rate
   - Average fetch time
   - Memory usage
   - Active subscriptions count

**Implementation:**
DevTools uses inspection API:
- QueryClient exposes inspection methods
- Extension polls for updates
- Data formatted for display
- Interactive controls modify state

**Security:**
In production builds:
- Sensitive data redacted
- Inspection disabled by default
- Requires explicit flag to enable
- Warning shown when enabled

### Testing Utilities

**The Problem:**
Testing code that uses queries is hard. Need to mock network, control time, simulate errors.

**The Solution:**
`fasq_testing` package with:

1. **Mock QueryClient:**
   - Preload cache with test data
   - Simulate network delays
   - Trigger errors on demand
   - Fast-forward time

2. **Test Helpers:**
   - Wait for query to complete
   - Verify cache state
   - Assert query called
   - Mock responses per query

3. **Time Control:**
   - Fast-forward to make data stale
   - Skip cache time for immediate disposal
   - Control retry delays

**Example:**
```dart
testWidgets('shows user data', (tester) async {
  final mockClient = MockQueryClient();
  mockClient.setQueryData('user', testUser);
  
  await tester.pumpWidget(
    QueryClientProvider(
      client: mockClient,
      child: UserScreen(),
    ),
  );
  
  expect(find.text(testUser.name), findsOneWidget);
});
```

## 6. Production Monitoring

### Logging Strategy

**Development Logging:**
- Verbose: every query event logged
- Full errors with stack traces
- Cache operations logged
- Performance warnings

**Production Logging:**
- Minimal: only significant events
- Errors without sensitive data
- Performance anomalies
- Critical warnings

**Configuration:**
```dart
QueryClient(
  logger: QueryLogger(
    level: kReleaseMode ? LogLevel.error : LogLevel.debug,
    redactSensitive: true,
  ),
)
```

### Performance Metrics

**Exposed Metrics:**
- Average query fetch time
- Cache hit rate (hits / total requests)
- Memory usage (current, peak)
- Active query count
- Failed request rate
- Retry rate

**Integration:**
Metrics available through:
- QueryClient API
- DevTools extension
- Custom analytics integration
- Performance monitoring services

### Error Tracking

**Guidance for Integration:**
Document how to integrate with:
- Sentry
- Firebase Crashlytics
- Datadog
- Custom error tracking

**Error Context:**
When errors occur, include:
- Query key
- Fetch function name
- Options used
- Retry attempt number
- Time since last success
- Network status

Without exposing:
- Sensitive data
- Full responses
- User identifiers (unless permitted)
