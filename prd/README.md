# FASQ - Product Requirements Documentation

This directory contains the complete Product Requirements Documentation (PRD) for the FASQ project, an async state management library for Flutter inspired by React Query. While primarily designed for API calls and server state, it elegantly handles any async operation including database queries, file I/O, and local computations.

## Documentation Structure

The PRD has been split into multiple focused documents to enable incremental development with clear milestones. Each phase builds upon the previous ones.

### Overview Document

üìã **[prd_overview.md](prd_overview.md)** - Start here!
- High-level project roadmap
- Phase dependencies and relationships
- Success metrics across all phases
- Risk management overview

### Phase-Specific PRDs

#### üéØ Phase 1: MVP - Core Query System
üìÑ **[prd_phase1_mvp.md](prd_phase1_mvp.md)**
- **Timeline:** Weeks 1-2
- **Focus:** Basic async operation handling without caching
- **Goal:** Prove the core concept works with any Future-based operation
- **Deliverables:** Query class, QueryBuilder widget, state management
- **Supports:** API calls, database queries, file I/O, any async operation

**Why Start Here:**
Building the foundational architecture without caching allows us to validate the core concepts before adding complexity. This phase proves that the library can handle any async operation (not just APIs) and that separating async logic from UI works perfectly. Establishes the API surface that works uniformly across all data sources.

#### üíæ Phase 2: Caching Layer
üìÑ **[prd_phase2_caching.md](prd_phase2_caching.md)**
- **Timeline:** Weeks 3-4
- **Focus:** Intelligent caching with memory management
- **Goal:** Add production-ready caching
- **Deliverables:** Cache storage, staleness detection, request deduplication, memory eviction

**Why This Phase:**
Caching transforms the library from a simple state manager into a sophisticated system that dramatically improves UX. This phase implements staleness detection, cache invalidation, and memory management that makes the library practical for production use.

---

#### üîå Phase 3: State Management Adapters
üìÑ **[prd_phase3_adapters.md](prd_phase3_adapters.md)**
- **Timeline:** Weeks 5-6
- **Focus:** Integration with Hooks, Bloc, and Riverpod
- **Goal:** Make the library accessible to all developers
- **Deliverables:** fasq_hooks, fasq_bloc, fasq_riverpod

**Why This Phase:**
Supporting multiple state management solutions maximizes adoption and validates that the core is truly state-agnostic. Each adapter provides an idiomatic API while sharing the same underlying query engine.

---

#### üöÄ Phase 4: Advanced Features
üìÑ **[prd_phase4_advanced_features.md](prd_phase4_advanced_features.md)**
- **Timeline:** Weeks 7-9
- **Focus:** Infinite queries, mutations, optimistic updates, offline support
- **Goal:** Enable complex real-world use cases
- **Deliverables:** Infinite queries, dependent queries, mutations, offline queue

**Why This Phase:**
Advanced features enable sophisticated patterns like pagination, optimistic UI updates, and offline-first workflows. These features differentiate the library from simple data fetchers and enable production-grade applications.

---

#### üõ°Ô∏è Phase 5: Production Hardening
üìÑ **[prd_phase5_production_hardening.md](prd_phase5_production_hardening.md)**
- **Timeline:** Weeks 10-12
- **Focus:** Security, performance, reliability, tooling
- **Goal:** Make the library production-ready
- **Deliverables:** Security hardening, performance optimization, DevTools, testing utilities

**Why This Phase:**
Production readiness requires attention to security, performance optimization, comprehensive error handling, and great developer tools. This phase ensures the library can be trusted in real production applications.

---

#### üéâ Phase 6: Polish and Release
üìÑ **[prd_phase6_release.md](prd_phase6_release.md)**
- **Timeline:** Weeks 13-14
- **Focus:** Beta testing, documentation, examples, launch
- **Goal:** Release stable v1.0
- **Deliverables:** Complete documentation, example apps, video tutorials, v1.0.0 release

**Why This Phase:**
A great product needs great documentation, examples, and launch execution. This phase ensures developers can easily adopt the library and that the community knows it exists.

## How to Use These Documents

### For Project Planning
1. Read `prd_overview.md` for the big picture
2. Review each phase PRD in order
3. Understand dependencies between phases
4. Estimate resources and timeline

### For Development
1. Start with Phase 1 PRD
2. Complete that phase fully before moving to next
3. Validate success criteria before proceeding
4. Use each PRD as implementation guide

### For Stakeholder Communication
- Share `prd_overview.md` for executive summary
- Share specific phase PRDs for detailed planning
- Use success criteria for progress tracking
- Reference risks and mitigations for project review

## Key Principles

### Incremental Development
Each phase produces working, usable software. Early phases can be released and tested before later phases begin.

### Clear Milestones
Each phase has explicit success criteria. No phase begins until the previous phase meets its criteria.

### Risk Management
Each PRD identifies risks specific to that phase and provides mitigation strategies.

### Focus and Scope
Each phase has a clear focus. Features outside the phase scope are explicitly documented as out-of-scope.

## Original PRD

üìö **[fasq_prd.md](fasq_prd.md)**
- Comprehensive single-document PRD
- Narrative format explaining concepts in depth
- Reference for understanding the vision
- Not used for implementation (use phase PRDs instead)

This original document provides deep context on the problems being solved, architectural decisions, and long-term vision. It's valuable for understanding the "why" behind each phase.

## Project Timeline Summary

| Phase | Weeks | Focus Area | Key Deliverable |
