## 1. Phase Overview

### Purpose

Phase 5 transforms Flutter Query from a feature-complete library into a production-ready, battle-tested solution. This phase focuses on security, performance optimization, reliability, error recovery, monitoring, and developer tooling. The goal is zero compromises on production quality.

### What We Will Build

Six major focus areas:
1. Security hardening (encrypted storage, secure cache)
2. Performance optimization (isolates, profiling, optimization)
3. Reliability improvements (retry logic, circuit breakers, cancellation)
4. Memory management (pressure handling, leak prevention)
5. Developer tools (DevTools extension, debugging utilities)
6. Production monitoring (logging, metrics, error tracking)

## 3. Security Hardening

### Secure Cache Entries

**The Problem:**

Authentication tokens, personal information, and payment details might be cached. This data must never be logged, persisted to disk unencrypted, or exposed through DevTools in production.

**The Solution:**

Queries can mark data as secure:

```
QueryOptions(
  isSecure: true,
  maxAge: Duration(minutes: 15),
)
```

Secure entries:
- Never written to disk (even if persistence enabled)
- Excluded from logs in production
- Redacted in DevTools unless explicitly enabled
- Auto-cleared on app background
- Auto-cleared on app terminate
- Enforced TTL (can't disable)

**Implementation:**

Cache entry has `isSecure` flag. Every operation checks this flag:
- Persistence layer skips secure entries
- Logger redacts secure data
- DevTools checks debug mode before showing
- Background listener clears secure entries
- TTL enforcement strict for secure data

**Testing:**

Verify secure data never appears in:
- Log files
- Persistence files
- DevTools in production mode
- Crash reports
- Analytics events

### Encrypted Persistence

**The Problem:**

When caching to disk, data is stored in plaintext. Compromised devices expose all cached data.

**The Solution:**

Optional encryption for persisted cache:

```
QueryClient(
  persistenceOptions: PersistenceOptions(
    encrypt: true,
    encryptionKey: await getSecureKey(),
  ),
)
```

Implementation uses platform secure storage for keys:
- iOS: Keychain
- Android: EncryptedSharedPreferences
- Web: Not supported (memory-only)
- Desktop: Platform-specific secure storage

Encryption transparent to application code. Decrypt on read, encrypt on write.

**Performance:**

Encryption adds overhead. Benchmark to ensure acceptable:
- Target: <20ms added latency for typical cache entry
- Use fast encryption (AES-GCM)
- Encrypt in background isolate for large data

### Input Validation

**The Problem:**

Malicious data in cache keys or query responses could cause security issues.

**The Solution:**

Validate all inputs:
- Query keys: alphanumeric, colons, hyphens only
- Cache data: type validation
- Options: range validation

Reject invalid inputs with clear errors. No execution of untrusted code.

## 4. Performance Optimization

### Isolate Support for JSON Parsing

**The Problem:**

Parsing large JSON responses blocks the main isolate, causing frame drops. Responses >100KB can freeze UI for 100ms+.

**The Solution:**

Automatically parse large responses in background isolate:

```
QueryOptions(
  useIsolate: true,
  isolateThreshold: 100 * 1024, // 100KB
)
```

Implementation:
- Small responses: parse on main isolate (faster due to no overhead)
- Large responses: send to isolate pool for parsing
- Isolate pool: maintain 2-3 isolates for parallelism
- Transfer parsed objects back to main isolate

**Challenges:**

Isolate communication requires sendable types. Custom objects need serialization. Simple data types (List, Map, String, num) work automatically.

**Performance Target:**

Response size | Main Isolate | Background Isolate
500KB | 150ms, blocks UI | 150ms, doesn't block UI
1MB | 300ms, blocks UI | 300ms, doesn't block UI
5MB | 1500ms, blocks UI | 1500ms, doesn't block UI

Parsing time same, but UI remains responsive with background parsing.

### Cache Optimization

**Current Performance:**

Phase 2 cache is functional but unoptimized. Phase 5 optimizes hot paths.

**Optimizations:**

1. **Fast Path for Hot Queries:**
   - Cache recently accessed queries in LRU list
   - Check LRU list before main map
   - Reduces lookup time for frequently accessed queries

2. **Batch Operations:**
   - Group multiple invalidations into single operation
   - Reduces lock contention
   - Notify listeners once after batch

3. **Lazy Metadata:**
   - Don't compute size estimates unless needed
   - Don't calculate staleness until accessed
   - Defer work until necessary

**Performance Targets:**

Operation | Phase 2 | Phase 5
Get (hot) | 2ms | <1ms
Get (cold) | 5ms | <3ms
Set | 8ms | <5ms
Invalidate | 10ms | <5ms

### Memory Optimization

**Reduce Memory Overhead:**

1. **Smaller State Objects:**
   - Use flyweight pattern for repeated data
   - Pool error objects
   - Reuse timestamp objects

2. **Optimize Strings:**
   - Intern query keys (same string = same object)
   - Use string buffers for concatenation
   - Avoid string copies

3. **Stream Optimization:**
   - Use single-subscription streams where possible
   - Close streams eagerly
   - Cancel subscriptions proactively

**Memory Targets:**

Component | Overhead
Query instance | <1KB
Cache entry | <200 bytes
Stream subscription | <100 bytes
Total for 1000 queries | <5MB

## 5. Reliability Improvements

### Intelligent Retry Logic

**The Problem:**

Network errors are often transient. Blindly retrying immediately wastes resources. Not retrying at all gives up too easily.

**The Solution:**

Exponential backoff with jitter:

```
RetryOptions(
  maxRetries: 3,
  initialDelay: Duration(seconds: 1),
  maxDelay: Duration(seconds: 30),
  backoffMultiplier: 2.0,
  jitter: true,
)
```

Retry sequence:
- Attempt 1 fails → wait 1s + jitter
- Attempt 2 fails → wait 2s + jitter
- Attempt 3 fails → wait 4s + jitter
- Attempt 4 fails → give up

Jitter prevents thundering herd when many clients retry simultaneously.

**Error Classification:**

Not all errors should retry:

Retryable:
- Network timeouts
- 5xx server errors
- Connection refused
- DNS failures

Non-retryable:
- 4xx client errors (except 429)
- 401 unauthorized
- 404 not found
- Invalid response format

Classification customizable per application.

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

**The Problem:**

When backend service is down, repeatedly hitting it wastes resources and delays failure detection. Apps should fail fast.

**The Solution:**

Circuit breaker tracks failure rate. When threshold exceeded, circuit "opens" and requests fail immediately without hitting backend.

**States:**

1. **Closed:** Normal operation, requests go through
2. **Open:** Too many failures, requests fail immediately
3. **Half-Open:** Testing if backend recovered

**State Transitions:**

Closed → Open: Failure rate exceeds threshold (e.g., 50% in 1 minute)
Open → Half-Open: After cooldown period (e.g., 30 seconds)
Half-Open → Closed: Test request succeeds
Half-Open → Open: Test request fails

**Configuration:**

```
CircuitBreakerOptions(
  failureThreshold: 0.5,
  windowDuration: Duration(minutes: 1),
  cooldownDuration: Duration(seconds: 30),
)
```

**Per-Endpoint:**

Circuit breakers are per endpoint, not global. One failing endpoint doesn't affect others.

### Request Cancellation

**The Problem:**

User navigates away before data loads. Request completes anyway, wasting bandwidth and updating stale cache.

**The Solution:**

Phase 1 included basic cancellation. Phase 5 makes it robust:

1. **Automatic Cancellation:**
   - Widget disposal cancels requests
   - Query disposal cancels requests
   - Timeout cancels requests

2. **Cancellation Propagation:**
   - Parent query cancellation cancels dependent queries
   - Mutation cancellation cancels optimistic update

3. **Resource Cleanup:**
   - Cancelled requests release network connections
   - Cancelled parsing stops immediately
   - Cancelled cache operations rollback

**Testing:**

Verify cancellation:
- Doesn't leak memory
- Doesn't corrupt cache
- Doesn't leave partial state
- Completes quickly (<100ms)

## 6. Memory Management

### Memory Pressure Handling

**The Problem:**

Low-memory devices run out of RAM. OS kills apps that consume too much. Cache can contribute to memory pressure.

**The Solution:**

Listen to platform memory warnings:

```
MemoryPressure.low → evict 25% of cache
MemoryPressure.medium → evict 50% of cache
MemoryPressure.critical → evict all non-active queries
```

Eviction prioritizes:
1. Inactive queries (no subscribers)
2. Large entries
3. Least recently used
4. Non-secure entries first

**Implementation:**

Platform-specific listeners:
- iOS: `didReceiveMemoryWarning`
- Android: `onTrimMemory`
- Web: Not applicable
- Desktop: Platform-specific

**Testing:**

Simulate memory pressure and verify:
- Cache size reduces
- App doesn't crash
- Active queries preserved
- Evicted queries refetch correctly

### Leak Prevention

**The Problem:**

Memory leaks accumulate over time. Slow leaks are hard to detect in development but catastrophic in production.

**The Solution:**

Multi-layered leak prevention:

1. **Automated Leak Detection:**
   - Tests monitor memory over time
   - Fail if memory grows unexpectedly
   - Detect leaked queries, streams, subscriptions

2. **Reference Counting:**
   - Every subscription tracked
   - Automatic cleanup when count reaches zero
   - Validation that counts never go negative

3. **Disposal Verification:**
   - Every created resource has disposal path
   - Tests verify disposal happens
   - Warnings if disposal takes too long

4. **Weak References:**
   - Use weak references where appropriate
   - Prevent circular references
   - Allow GC to reclaim memory

**Leak Testing:**

24-hour stress test:
- Create 1000 queries per minute
- Navigate between screens
- Monitor memory usage
- Verify stable memory (not growing)

---

## 7. Developer Tools

### DevTools Extension

**The Problem:**

Debugging query issues requires visibility into cache state, active queries, network requests, and state transitions.

**The Solution:**

Flutter DevTools extension showing:

1. **Query Inspector:**
   - List all active queries
   - Show query state, data, error
   - Display staleness, cache time
   - Show subscriber count

2. **Cache Visualizer:**
   - Browse cache entries
   - See entry metadata
   - Inspect cached data
   - Clear specific entries

3. **Network Activity:**
   - Timeline of requests
   - Request/response details
   - Success/error status
   - Timing information

4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Cache hit rate
   - Average fetch time
   - Memory usage
   - Active subscriptions count

**Implementation:**

DevTools uses inspection API:
- QueryClient exposes inspection methods
- Extension polls for updates
- Data formatted for display
- Interactive controls modify state

**Security:**

In production builds:
- Sensitive data redacted
- Inspection disabled by default
- Requires explicit flag to enable
- Warning shown when enabled

### Testing Utilities

**The Problem:**

Testing code that uses queries is hard. Need to mock network, control time, simulate errors.

**The Solution:**

`flutter_query_testing` package with:

1. **Mock QueryClient:**
   - Preload cache with test data
   - Simulate network delays
   - Trigger errors on demand
   - Fast-forward time

2. **Test Helpers:**
   - Wait for query to complete
   - Verify cache state
   - Assert query called
   - Mock responses per query

3. **Time Control:**
   - Fast-forward to make data stale
   - Skip cache time for immediate disposal
   - Control retry delays

**Example:**

```dart
testWidgets('shows user data', (tester) async {
  final mockClient = MockQueryClient();
  mockClient.setQueryData('user', testUser);
  
  await tester.pumpWidget(
    QueryClientProvider(
      client: mockClient,
      child: UserScreen(),
    ),
  );
  
  expect(find.text(testUser.name), findsOneWidget);
});
```

## 8. Production Monitoring

### Logging Strategy

**Development Logging:**
- Verbose: every query event logged
- Full errors with stack traces
- Cache operations logged
- Performance warnings

**Production Logging:**
- Minimal: only significant events
- Errors without sensitive data
- Performance anomalies
- Critical warnings

**Configuration:**

```
QueryClient(
  logger: QueryLogger(
    level: kReleaseMode ? LogLevel.error : LogLevel.debug,
    redactSensitive: true,
  ),
)
```

### Performance Metrics

**Exposed Metrics:**

- Average query fetch time
- Cache hit rate (hits / total requests)
- Memory usage (current, peak)
- Active query count
- Failed request rate
- Retry rate

**Integration:**

Metrics available through:
- QueryClient API
- DevTools extension
- Custom analytics integration
- Performance monitoring services

### Error Tracking

**Guidance for Integration:**

Document how to integrate with:
- Sentry
- Firebase Crashlytics
- Datadog
- Custom error tracking

**Error Context:**

When errors occur, include:
- Query key
- Fetch function name
- Options used
- Retry attempt number
- Time since last success
- Network status

Without exposing:
- Sensitive data
- Full responses
- User identifiers (unless permitted)
