# Flutter Query - Development Roadmap Overview

**Project:** Flutter Query - Server State Management for Flutter  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning

---

## Purpose

This document provides a high-level overview of the Flutter Query development roadmap. The project is broken down into multiple phases, each with its own dedicated Product Requirements Document (PRD). This approach allows for focused, incremental development with clear milestones and deliverables.

## Development Philosophy

Rather than building everything at once, we follow an iterative approach where each phase builds upon the previous one. Early phases focus on core functionality and proving the concept, while later phases add sophistication, performance optimizations, and production hardening.

Each phase is designed to produce a working, usable result that could be tested and validated before moving to the next phase. This reduces risk and allows for course correction based on real feedback.

## Phase Overview

### Phase 1: MVP - Core Query System
**Document:** `prd_phase1_mvp.md`  
**Timeline:** Weeks 1-2  
**Focus:** Basic query functionality with simple state management

**Goal:** Prove the core concept works. Build the absolute minimum needed to handle async operations (primarily API calls), manage loading/error/success states, and provide a simple API that developers can use.

**Scope:**
- Basic Query class and lifecycle for any async operation
- Simple in-memory state (no caching yet)
- QueryBuilder widget for Flutter integration
- Basic error handling
- Stream-based state updates
- Works with any Future-returning function
- Simple examples demonstrating the concept

**Success Criteria:**
- Developers can fetch data and display it in widgets
- Loading, error, and success states work correctly
- State updates propagate to UI
- Clean code with >80% test coverage
- Working example app

### Phase 2: Caching Layer
**Document:** `prd_phase2_caching.md`  
**Timeline:** Weeks 3-4  
**Focus:** Intelligent caching system with memory management

**Goal:** Add sophisticated caching that makes the library practical for production use. Implement staleness detection, cache invalidation, and memory management.

**Scope:**
- Cache entry storage with metadata
- Staleness configuration (staleTime, cacheTime)
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Memory limits and eviction policies (LRU)
- Reference counting for cleanup
- Request deduplication
- Cache inspection and debugging tools

**Success Criteria:**
- Data is cached and served on subsequent requests
- Stale data refetches automatically
- Unused cache entries are cleaned up
- Memory usage stays within configured limits
- Duplicate requests are deduplicated
- Performance: cache access <5ms

### Phase 3: State Management Adapters
**Document:** `prd_phase3_adapters.md`  
**Timeline:** Weeks 5-6  
**Focus:** Integration with popular state management solutions

**Goal:** Make Flutter Query accessible to developers using different state management approaches. Provide idiomatic APIs for each ecosystem.

**Scope:**
- Flutter Hooks adapter (useQuery, useMutation)
- Bloc adapter (QueryCubit, MutationCubit)
- Riverpod adapter (queryProvider, mutationProvider)
- Adapter testing and examples
- Migration guides

**Success Criteria:**
- Each adapter feels natural in its ecosystem
- Consistent behavior across all adapters
- Proper lifecycle management and cleanup
- Comprehensive examples for each adapter
- Zero memory leaks in any adapter

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
**Document:** `prd_phase4_advanced_features.md`  
**Timeline:** Weeks 7-9  
**Focus:** Complex query patterns and mutations

**Goal:** Enable advanced use cases like pagination, dependent queries, optimistic updates, and offline support.

**Scope:**
- Infinite queries for pagination
- Dependent queries (wait for prerequisites)
- Mutations with optimistic updates
- Rollback on error
- Parallel queries
- Query prefetching
- Offline mutation queue
- Network status detection

**Success Criteria:**
- Pagination works smoothly without UI flicker
- Dependent queries execute in correct order
- Optimistic updates with proper rollback
- Offline mutations queue and retry correctly
- All features work across all adapters

---

### Phase 5: Production Hardening
**Document:** `prd_phase5_production_hardening.md`  
**Timeline:** Weeks 10-12  
**Focus:** Security, performance, reliability, and tooling

**Goal:** Make the library production-ready with comprehensive security, excellent performance, and great developer tools.

**Scope:**
- Security: secure cache entries, encryption
- Performance: isolate support, optimization
- Error recovery: retry logic, circuit breakers
- Cancellation: request cancellation tokens
- DevTools: query inspector, cache visualizer
- Testing utilities: mocks and helpers
- Memory management: pressure handling
- Background sync: app lifecycle integration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Production deployment guide

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero critical security issues
- Performance benchmarks published
- 24-hour stress test passes
- DevTools provides actionable insights
- Complete production-ready documentation
- 3+ apps successfully using in production

---

### Phase 6: Polish and Release
**Document:** `prd_phase6_release.md`  
**Timeline:** Weeks 13-14  
**Focus:** Final polish, documentation, and v1.0 release

**Goal:** Release a stable v1.0 that the Flutter community can confidently adopt.

**Scope:**
- Bug fixes from beta feedback
- Performance optimization
- Documentation polish
- Video tutorials
- Migration guides from other solutions
- Example applications
- Marketing materials
- Release announcement

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero critical bugs
- All documentation complete
- Positive beta feedback
- Ready for pub.dev release
- Marketing plan executed

## Dependencies Between Phases

**Phase 1 → Phase 2:** Caching builds on core query system  
**Phase 2 → Phase 3:** Adapters need caching to be useful  
**Phase 3 → Phase 4:** Advanced features work through adapters  
**Phase 4 → Phase 5:** Production hardening requires all features  
**Phase 5 → Phase 6:** Release requires production-ready library

Each phase assumes the previous phases are complete and stable. However, minor improvements to earlier phases can happen during later phases as needed.

## Risk Management

**Early Phase Risks:**
- Core architecture decisions may need revision
- Mitigation: Thorough design review before Phase 1, willingness to refactor

**Middle Phase Risks:**
- Adapter pattern may not work for all state management solutions
- Mitigation: Build simplest adapter first, validate pattern early

**Late Phase Risks:**
- Performance or security issues discovered late
- Mitigation: Continuous testing and profiling throughout all phases

## Success Metrics

**Technical:**
- All tests passing with >85% coverage
- Performance benchmarks met
- Zero memory leaks
- Works on all Flutter platforms

**Adoption:**
- 10+ developers testing during beta
- 3+ production apps by release
- Positive community feedback

**Quality:**
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear error messages
- Good developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this overview document
2. Create detailed PRD for Phase 1 (MVP)
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Iterate based on learnings from each phase
