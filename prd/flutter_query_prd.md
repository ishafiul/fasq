# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Flutter Query - Server State Management for Flutter

**Version:** 2.0  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Flutter Query is a comprehensive async state management library designed specifically for Flutter applications. The library draws inspiration from proven solutions like React Query and SWR but is built from the ground up to work seamlessly within the Flutter ecosystem. While primarily designed for server state management (API calls), it elegantly handles any async operation including database queries, file I/O, and local computations. The core mission is to eliminate the repetitive, error-prone code that developers write for managing async operations while providing a production-ready solution that handles the complexities of caching, synchronization, and error recovery automatically.

The library follows a modular architecture where a zero-dependency core package provides all essential functionality, and optional adapter packages integrate with popular state management solutions like Bloc, Riverpod, and Flutter Hooks. This approach ensures developers can adopt the library regardless of their existing tech stack while maintaining the flexibility to switch state management solutions without rewriting their data fetching logic.

## 2. Problem Statement

### The Current State of Async Operation Management in Flutter

Flutter developers currently spend a disproportionate amount of time implementing repetitive patterns for async operations. Every async task—whether API calls, database queries, file operations, or background computations—requires setting up loading states, error handling, caching mechanisms, and refresh logic. This boilerplate code is not only time-consuming to write but also becomes a maintenance burden as applications grow. While API calls are the most common use case, the problem exists for all async operations.

### Specific Pain Points

**Excessive Boilerplate Code**

When developers need to execute any async operation—whether fetching data from an API, reading from a database, or loading a file—they typically need to manage at least three distinct states: loading, success, and error. For each async operation, they create state classes, write execution logic, handle edge cases, and implement caching strategies. This often results in fifty or more lines of code per operation, with most of it being nearly identical whether it's an API call, database query, or file read.

**Manual Cache Management**

Caching is critical for good user experience, but implementing it correctly is complex. Developers must decide when data is stale, when to invalidate the cache, how to handle cache size limits, and how to prevent memory leaks. Most applications either skip caching entirely or implement ad-hoc solutions that are fragile and difficult to maintain.

**Duplicate Network Requests**

When multiple widgets need the same data simultaneously, each one typically makes its own network request. This wastes bandwidth, increases server load, and creates inconsistent states where different parts of the UI might be showing different versions of the same data. Proper request deduplication requires complex coordination that most developers skip.

**Complex Background Synchronization**

Modern applications need to keep data fresh by refetching when the user returns to the app, when network connectivity is restored, or at regular intervals. Implementing this requires managing timers, listening to app lifecycle events, monitoring network status, and coordinating all these concerns with the existing state management solution.

**Difficult Optimistic Updates**

For good user experience, applications should update the UI immediately when the user takes an action, then sync with the server in the background. However, implementing this pattern correctly requires saving the previous state for rollback, handling concurrent updates, and managing the complexity of partial failures. Most applications either skip optimistic updates or implement them incorrectly, leading to data corruption.

**State Management Lock-In**

Current solutions for server state management are typically tightly coupled to specific state management patterns. If a team decides to migrate from Bloc to Riverpod, or vice versa, they must rewrite all their data fetching logic. This creates artificial barriers that prevent teams from choosing the best tool for each situation.

---

## 3. Solution Overview

### Core Philosophy

Flutter Query addresses these challenges by treating async operation state as fundamentally different from synchronous client state. While client state like form inputs or UI toggles belongs to the component that created it, async operation results (whether from APIs, databases, or files) represent shared data that can be accessed by any part of the application. This distinction drives the entire architecture of the library.

The library is agnostic about the source of data. Whether you're calling a REST API, querying SQLite, reading a file, or performing a computation in an isolate, the library handles it the same way: as an async operation that produces data, might fail, and benefits from caching. This unified approach means you learn one pattern that works everywhere.

### What Flutter Query Provides

**Automatic Caching with Intelligence**

The library implements a sophisticated caching system that automatically stores query results and serves them to subsequent requests. The cache is intelligent enough to know when data is fresh, when it's stale but usable, and when it must be refetched. Developers configure staleness thresholds, and the library handles all the complexity of cache invalidation, memory management, and cleanup.

**Built-In Request Deduplication**

When multiple components request the same data simultaneously, Flutter Query ensures only one network request is made. All requesters receive the same result, eliminating duplicate requests and ensuring consistency. This works transparently without requiring developers to implement any coordination logic.

**Comprehensive Background Synchronization**

The library automatically handles all background synchronization scenarios. When a user backgrounds the app and returns, queries are intelligently refetched based on how long they've been idle. When network connectivity is restored after being offline, failed requests are automatically retried. Developers can configure polling intervals for real-time data, and the library manages all the timers and cleanup automatically.

**First-Class Optimistic Updates**

Flutter Query provides a structured approach to optimistic updates that handles all the edge cases correctly. Before a mutation is sent to the server, developers can update the cache with the expected result. If the mutation fails, the library automatically rolls back to the previous state. If multiple mutations happen concurrently, the library ensures they're applied in the correct order without data corruption.

**Complete State Management Flexibility**

The core library has zero dependencies and exposes a stream-based API that works with any state management solution. Official adapters for Hooks, Bloc, and Riverpod provide idiomatic APIs for each ecosystem. This means teams can migrate between state management solutions by simply swapping the adapter, without touching any of their query logic.

### Architecture Overview

The library is organized into multiple packages that work together but can be adopted independently. The core package contains all the essential query logic, caching, and synchronization features. It uses only built-in Dart and Flutter APIs, ensuring maximum compatibility and minimal dependency conflicts.

Adapter packages sit on top of the core and provide state-management-specific APIs. For example, the Hooks adapter exports custom hooks like useQuery and useMutation that feel natural to Hooks users, while the Bloc adapter provides Cubits that integrate with the existing Bloc ecosystem. All adapters share the same underlying query engine, so behavior is consistent regardless of which one you use.

Optional extension packages provide additional functionality like DevTools integration, testing utilities, and persistence layers. These are separate packages so developers only include what they need, keeping bundle sizes minimal.

## 4. Goals and Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

The overarching goal is to become the standard solution for server state management in Flutter, much like React Query has become the standard in the React ecosystem. This requires achieving several specific objectives.

**Drastically Reduce Development Time**

The library should reduce the amount of code developers write for data fetching by at least seventy percent. This isn't just about fewer lines of code, but about eliminating entire categories of problems that developers currently have to think about. Cache management, request deduplication, background sync, and error recovery should all become automatic concerns that developers can rely on without implementing themselves.

**Provide Exceptional Developer Experience**

The API should feel natural and intuitive to Flutter developers. It should follow Flutter conventions, integrate seamlessly with existing tools, and provide clear, actionable error messages when something goes wrong. The documentation should be comprehensive enough that developers can find answers to their questions without needing to ask for help.

**Support All Major State Management Solutions**

The library should work equally well whether a team uses Hooks, Bloc, Riverpod, GetX, or any other state management solution. No team should feel locked into a particular approach because of their data fetching layer. The adapters should provide idiomatic APIs for each ecosystem while maintaining consistent behavior.

**Enable Zero-Lock-In Architecture**

Teams should be able to adopt Flutter Query incrementally, migrate between different state management solutions without rewriting queries, and even stop using the library without major refactoring if it doesn't meet their needs. This requires clean separation between the query logic and the presentation layer.

### How Success Will Be Measured

Success will be evaluated across multiple dimensions including adoption metrics, technical performance, and community health. Adoption will be tracked through package downloads, GitHub stars, and most importantly, real production applications successfully using the library. Technical success means maintaining high performance, zero critical bugs, and comprehensive test coverage. Community health is measured by contributor activity, documentation quality, and positive sentiment in discussions and reviews.

## 5. User Stories and Use Cases

### Mobile Developer Building a Data-Driven Application

A mobile developer is building an e-commerce application that needs data from multiple sources: product listings from REST API, user preferences from local database, configuration from JSON files, and cart data from GraphQL. Each of these async operations requires loading states, error handling, and caching.

With Flutter Query, the developer defines queries for each async operation with simple configuration. The library automatically handles loading states, caches responses, and refetches data when it becomes stale. The same pattern works whether the data comes from an API endpoint, SQLite query, or file read. When the user navigates between screens, previously loaded data is instantly available from the cache while fresh data loads in the background. The developer writes only the business logic and presentation code, not the infrastructure for managing async operations.

### Team Lead Managing a Large Codebase

A team lead oversees an application with hundreds of API endpoints and dozens of developers contributing code. The team currently uses Bloc for state management, but some developers find it verbose and want to experiment with Riverpod for new features.

With Flutter Query, the team can adopt Riverpod for new features while keeping existing Bloc code unchanged. The query layer remains identical, only the adapter changes. Over time, if the team decides to fully migrate to Riverpod, they can do so screen by screen without a big-bang rewrite. The query logic, which represents significant business logic, remains completely unchanged throughout the migration.

### Developer Implementing Real-Time Features

A developer is adding a messaging feature that needs to poll for new messages every few seconds when the conversation screen is open, but should stop polling when the screen is closed to save battery and bandwidth.

Flutter Query handles this automatically through its lifecycle management. When the screen is mounted, the query becomes active and polls at the configured interval. When the screen is unmounted, polling stops automatically. If the user backgrounds the app, polling pauses. When they return, the query refetches once to catch up, then resumes polling. The developer configures the polling interval but doesn't write any of the lifecycle management code.

### Developer Building an Offline-First Application

A developer is building a field service application where workers frequently have poor or no internet connectivity. The application needs to allow workers to submit reports even when offline, queue those submissions, and sync them when connectivity is restored.

Flutter Query provides an offline mutation queue that persists failed mutations and automatically retries them when the network is available. The developer marks mutations as offline-capable, and the library handles all the complexity of queueing, persistence, retry logic, and conflict resolution. The UI can optimistically update while offline, and the library ensures data eventually reaches the server.

---

## 6. Technical Architecture and Design

### Core Package Architecture

The core package is the foundation of the entire library and must be completely self-contained with zero external dependencies. This ensures maximum compatibility, minimal dependency conflicts, and makes the library suitable for production use in any Flutter application.

**Query Management System**

At the heart of the library is the Query class, which represents a single data fetching operation. Each query has a unique key that identifies it, a function that performs the actual data fetching, and a stream that emits state changes. The Query class is responsible for managing its own lifecycle, including when to fetch, when to refetch, and when to clean up resources.

Queries are not widgets or state management objects. They're pure logic classes that can be used from anywhere in the application. This separation is crucial for testability and flexibility. Widgets subscribe to query state through adapters, but the query itself doesn't know or care about the UI layer.

**Thread-Safe Cache Implementation**

The cache is where all query results are stored and must be completely thread-safe to prevent race conditions. Every cache operation is protected by locks to ensure that concurrent access from multiple queries or widgets doesn't corrupt the cache state.

The cache implementation uses a map-based structure where keys are query identifiers and values are cache entries. Each cache entry contains not just the data, but also metadata like when the data was created, when it was last accessed, how many times it's been accessed, and whether it should be persisted to disk.

Memory management is critical for the cache. The library implements configurable eviction policies including Least Recently Used, Least Frequently Used, and First In First Out. When the cache exceeds its size limit, the eviction policy determines which entries to remove. The library also listens to platform memory pressure events and proactively evicts cache entries when the system is running low on memory.

**Request Deduplication Engine**

When multiple components request the same data simultaneously, only one network request should be made. The deduplication engine maintains a map of in-flight requests. Before making a new request, the engine checks if an identical request is already in progress. If so, it returns a reference to the existing future rather than creating a new request.

This is more complex than it sounds because requests can be cancelled, can time out, or can fail. The deduplication engine must handle all these cases correctly, ensuring that all requesters are notified when the request completes or fails, and that the request is removed from the in-flight map at the appropriate time.

**Cancellation Token System**

Every query function receives a cancellation token that allows the request to be cancelled mid-flight. This is essential for preventing memory leaks and wasted bandwidth when a user navigates away from a screen before data loads.

The cancellation token is a simple object with a boolean flag and a completer. When the query is cancelled, the flag is set and the completer fires. Query functions can check the flag periodically or await the completer to know when to stop processing. The library automatically cancels queries when widgets are unmounted, ensuring resources are properly cleaned up.

**Error Classification and Retry Logic**

Not all errors should be handled the same way. Network timeouts and server errors are usually transient and should be retried. Client errors like 404 or 401 are permanent and retrying won't help. The library classifies errors into categories and applies different strategies to each.

The retry system implements exponential backoff, where each retry waits longer than the previous one. This prevents overwhelming a failing server while still recovering quickly when the issue resolves. The backoff multiplier, maximum retry count, and maximum delay are all configurable per query.

Error classification happens by examining the error type and any associated HTTP status codes. Developers can also provide custom classification functions for domain-specific error types. This ensures the retry logic makes appropriate decisions for each application's specific API characteristics.

**Logging and Debugging Infrastructure**

Production debugging is challenging when issues only appear in real-world usage. The library includes a comprehensive logging system that records all query lifecycle events, cache operations, network requests, and errors.

In development mode, logs are verbose and include full stack traces. In production mode, logs are minimal and optimized to avoid performance overhead. The logging system is pluggable, allowing developers to integrate with their existing logging infrastructure or analytics tools.

### Memory Management Strategy

Memory leaks are one of the most common and serious issues in production Flutter applications. Flutter Query must be extremely careful about resource management to avoid becoming a source of leaks.

**Reference Counting and Cleanup**

Each query tracks how many active subscribers it has. When a widget subscribes to a query, the reference count increases. When a widget unsubscribes, the count decreases. When the count reaches zero and the query has been inactive for the configured cache time, the query is disposed and removed from the cache.

This automatic cleanup ensures that queries for screens the user will never return to don't remain in memory forever. However, the cache time provides a buffer so that quickly navigating away and back doesn't cause unnecessary refetches.

**Cache Size Limits**

The cache has a configurable maximum size measured in bytes. When adding a new entry would exceed this limit, the library evicts existing entries based on the configured eviction policy. This prevents the cache from growing without bounds and consuming all available memory.

Calculating the size of cache entries is complex because Dart doesn't provide a built-in way to measure object memory usage. The library uses heuristics based on the number of fields, string lengths, and collection sizes to estimate memory usage. While not perfectly accurate, these estimates are good enough to prevent runaway memory growth.

**Memory Pressure Handling**

The library registers a listener for platform memory pressure events. When the operating system indicates memory is running low, the library proactively evicts cache entries to free memory. The aggressiveness of eviction scales with the severity of the memory pressure.

On low memory pressure, the library evicts twenty-five percent of the cache using the normal eviction policy. On medium pressure, fifty percent is evicted. On critical pressure, the entire cache is cleared except for currently active queries. This helps prevent the operating system from killing the application due to memory constraints.

### Concurrency Control

Concurrent access to shared state is a major source of bugs. The library must ensure that all shared state is accessed in a thread-safe manner.

**Lock-Based Synchronization**

Every cache key has an associated lock. Before performing any operation on a cache entry, the library acquires the lock for that key. This ensures that only one operation can modify a cache entry at a time, preventing race conditions.

The locks are reentrant, meaning the same isolate can acquire a lock multiple times. This is important for operations that need to read and then modify the same cache entry. The locks also have timeouts to prevent deadlocks if something goes wrong.

**Atomic Cache Operations**

All cache operations are atomic from the perspective of external callers. When a query sets data in the cache, all subscribers either see the old data or the new data, never a partial update. This is achieved through the lock system and careful ordering of operations.

Read-modify-write operations are particularly tricky. For example, optimistic updates need to read the current value, modify it, and write it back. The library ensures this entire sequence happens atomically under a single lock acquisition.

### Security and Sensitive Data Handling

Production applications frequently handle sensitive data like authentication tokens, personal information, and payment details. The library must provide mechanisms to ensure this data is handled securely.

**Secure Cache Entries**

Queries can be marked as containing sensitive data. These entries are never persisted to disk, even if persistence is enabled. They're also automatically cleared when the application goes to the background or is terminated. This prevents sensitive data from being exposed if the device is compromised.

Secure entries are also excluded from debug logs and DevTools inspection in production builds. This prevents accidental logging of sensitive information to analytics or crash reporting systems.

**Time-To-Live Enforcement**

Sensitive data often has strict freshness requirements. Authentication tokens might be valid for only fifteen minutes. The library allows setting a maximum age for cache entries, after which they're automatically invalidated regardless of staleness configuration.

This is different from regular staleness because the data becomes completely invalid, not just stale. Any attempt to access an expired entry returns undefined, forcing a refetch. This ensures that expired credentials or time-sensitive data never lingers in the cache.

**Encryption for Persistence**

When persistence is enabled and the application uses encrypted storage, cache entries can optionally be encrypted before being written to disk. The library integrates with platform-specific secure storage mechanisms to ensure encryption keys are properly protected.

The encryption is transparent to the application code. Queries marked for secure persistence are automatically encrypted on write and decrypted on read. The library handles all the complexity of key management and cipher initialization.

### Performance Optimization

The library must be fast enough that it never becomes a bottleneck in application performance. Every operation is optimized to minimize latency and overhead.

**Request Deduplication**

As discussed earlier, request deduplication ensures that identical concurrent requests result in only one network call. This is primarily a bandwidth optimization, but it also improves perceived performance because all requesters receive results as soon as the single request completes.

The deduplication system is smart enough to handle requests with different options. Two requests for the same data with different staleness times are considered different requests and won't be deduplicated. This ensures that a request for fresh data doesn't accidentally receive stale data from a concurrent request.

**Isolate Support for Heavy Processing**

Parsing large JSON responses can block the UI thread and cause frame drops. The library can automatically offload JSON parsing to a background isolate when the response exceeds a configurable size threshold.

This requires careful management of data transfer between isolates. The library uses efficient serialization and ensures that the overhead of isolate communication doesn't outweigh the benefits. For small responses, parsing on the main isolate is faster despite blocking briefly.

**Smart Cache Invalidation**

When data is mutated on the server, related queries need to be invalidated. But invalidating too broadly causes unnecessary refetches, while invalidating too narrowly leaves stale data in the cache.

The library supports several invalidation strategies. Simple key matching invalidates queries with exact key matches. Prefix matching invalidates all queries whose keys start with a specific prefix. Predicate matching allows custom logic to determine which queries to invalidate. This flexibility allows developers to invalidate precisely the queries that need updating.

### Adapter Architecture

Adapters bridge the gap between the state-agnostic core and state-management-specific APIs. Each adapter provides an idiomatic API for its ecosystem while delegating all query logic to the core.

**Hooks Adapter Design**

The Hooks adapter exports custom hooks that manage query lifecycle automatically. When a hook is called, it creates or retrieves the query from the cache, subscribes to its state stream, and returns the current state. When the widget unmounts, the hook automatically unsubscribes.

The hook takes care of all the React-like behavior that Hooks users expect, such as only refetching when dependencies change, not on every rebuild. This is implemented by tracking the previous key and options and comparing them to the current values on each render.

**Bloc Adapter Design**

The Bloc adapter provides Cubits that wrap queries. Each QueryCubit manages a single query and emits query state changes as Cubit states. This allows queries to integrate seamlessly into existing Bloc architectures.

The tricky part is managing the relationship between the Cubit lifecycle and the query lifecycle. When a Cubit is closed, it must clean up its query subscription and potentially dispose the query if no other subscribers exist. The adapter handles all this complexity automatically.

**Riverpod Adapter Design**

The Riverpod adapter provides providers that create and manage queries. Riverpod's auto-dispose feature aligns naturally with query lifecycle management. When a provider has no listeners, it auto-disposes, which can trigger query cleanup.

The adapter leverages Riverpod's family feature for parameterized queries, allowing dynamic query creation based on parameters. This makes it easy to create queries for specific entities like individual users or products.

---

## 7. API Design Principles

### Simplicity First

The API should be as simple as possible while still providing all necessary functionality. Common use cases should require minimal code, while advanced use cases should be possible without excessive complexity.

Every API surface is evaluated based on whether it makes the common case simpler and whether the uncommon case remains achievable. Features that only benefit rare use cases are relegated to advanced options rather than cluttering the primary API.

### Type Safety

Flutter developers expect strong type safety, and the library must deliver. All query results, error types, and state changes should be properly typed. Generic types should flow through the entire system so that accessing query data doesn't require type casts.

The challenge is maintaining type safety while allowing the flexibility needed for real-world use cases. The library uses advanced generic constraints and type unions to express complex type relationships while keeping the API surface clean.

### Progressive Disclosure

Beginners should be able to accomplish basic tasks with minimal learning, while experts should be able to access advanced features when needed. This is achieved through sensible defaults and optional configuration.

A basic query can be created with just a key and a fetch function. Everything else has reasonable defaults. As developers need more control, they can add options one at a time without learning the entire configuration surface upfront.

### Explicit Over Implicit

Magic behavior is confusing and hard to debug. The library prefers explicit configuration over implicit behavior whenever there's ambiguity. This means slightly more verbose code in exchange for predictability and debuggability.

For example, queries don't automatically refetch on mount by default. Developers must explicitly enable this behavior if they want it. This prevents surprising refetches that waste bandwidth and confuse developers trying to understand why their app is making unexpected network requests.

---

## 8. Implementation Phases and Milestones

### Phase One: Production-Ready Core

The first phase focuses exclusively on building a robust, production-grade core package. This is the foundation that everything else builds on, so it must be absolutely solid before moving forward.

The core implementation starts with the basic query lifecycle: creating queries, fetching data, caching results, and serving cached data to subsequent requests. Once this basic flow works, the focus shifts to production concerns like thread safety, memory management, and error handling.

Thread safety is verified through extensive concurrency testing where hundreds of queries run simultaneously, all accessing and modifying the cache. Memory management is validated through long-running stress tests that monitor memory usage over twenty-four hours of continuous operation. Error handling is tested with chaos engineering techniques that randomly inject failures at every level.

The goal is not just to make the core work for the happy path, but to ensure it handles every edge case correctly. Memory leaks, race conditions, and error recovery must all be bulletproof before proceeding to the next phase.

### Phase Two: Security and Resilience

With a solid core in place, the second phase adds the features necessary for production deployment in security-conscious environments. This includes secure cache handling, circuit breakers, offline support, and comprehensive error recovery.

Secure cache entries are implemented with special handling that prevents persistence, automatic clearing on background, and exclusion from logs. The implementation is thoroughly tested to ensure that marking an entry as secure actually provides the promised protections.

Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures when a backend service is degraded. The implementation monitors failure rates and automatically stops sending requests to failing endpoints, giving them time to recover. This protects both the client and server from being overwhelmed by doomed requests.

Offline mutation queues allow applications to continue functioning without network connectivity. Mutations are persisted locally and automatically retried when connectivity is restored. The implementation handles edge cases like the app being terminated while mutations are queued and conflicts when the same data is modified locally and remotely.

### Phase Three: State Management Adapters

With the core complete and hardened, the focus shifts to building adapters that make the library accessible to developers using different state management solutions. The Hooks adapter comes first because it's the simplest and serves as a reference for the pattern.

Each adapter is built to feel natural within its ecosystem. The Hooks adapter provides custom hooks that automatically manage subscriptions and cleanup. The Bloc adapter provides Cubits that emit query states. The Riverpod adapter provides providers that integrate with Riverpod's dependency injection and auto-dispose features.

The implementation effort focuses on correct lifecycle management. Each adapter must properly subscribe to queries when widgets mount, unsubscribe when they unmount, handle hot reload correctly, and clean up resources. Memory leak testing is critical here because adapter bugs are a common source of leaks in production.

### Phase Four: Advanced Features

With basic query functionality available through multiple adapters, the fourth phase adds advanced features that unlock more complex use cases. This includes infinite queries for pagination, dependent queries that wait for prerequisite data, and optimistic updates with automatic rollback.

Infinite queries maintain a list of pages rather than a single data value. The implementation handles loading additional pages, error recovery when a specific page fails, and cache invalidation that preserves already-loaded pages. This is significantly more complex than simple queries and requires careful state management.

Dependent queries wait for other queries to complete before fetching. The implementation monitors dependencies and triggers fetches when dependencies become available. This enables patterns like fetching user details and then fetching that user's posts, where the second query depends on data from the first.

Optimistic updates let applications update the UI immediately before the server confirms the change. The implementation snapshots the current state before applying the optimistic update, so it can be rolled back if the mutation fails. Handling concurrent optimistic updates without data corruption requires careful coordination and transaction-like semantics.

### Phase Five: Developer Experience and Tooling

The final phase before release focuses on making the library accessible and debuggable. This includes comprehensive documentation, DevTools integration, testing utilities, and example applications.

The DevTools extension provides a visual interface for inspecting active queries, browsing the cache, monitoring network activity, and viewing performance metrics. The implementation is careful to avoid impacting production performance and provides options to disable or redact sensitive information.

Testing utilities make it easy to write tests for code that uses queries. This includes mock query clients, utilities for simulating time passing, and helpers for triggering refetches and mutations in tests. The utilities are designed to make testing query-dependent code as simple as testing regular code.

Documentation is comprehensive and example-rich. Every API has examples showing common usage patterns. Guides cover topics like migration from other solutions, performance tuning, and production deployment. Video tutorials demonstrate complex workflows that are hard to explain in text.

## 9. Out of Scope

### What This Library Will Not Do

It's important to clearly define what the library will not attempt to solve, both to manage expectations and to maintain a focused scope.

**Local State Management**

The library focuses exclusively on server state. It will not provide solutions for form state, UI toggles, navigation state, or any other client-side state. These concerns are better handled by existing state management solutions, and the library is designed to work alongside them, not replace them.

**GraphQL Integration**

The first version will focus on REST and HTTP-based APIs. GraphQL has unique characteristics like query composition and normalized caching that would significantly complicate the implementation. Future versions might provide GraphQL support through a plugin architecture, but it's explicitly out of scope for version one.

**Custom Serialization**

The library will not provide built-in serialization or deserialization. Developers are responsible for converting API responses to Dart objects and vice versa. This keeps the library simple and allows it to work with any serialization approach developers prefer.

**Built-In HTTP Client**

The library will not include an HTTP client. It works with any Future-returning function, so developers can use dio, http, or any other networking library they prefer. This avoids forcing a specific HTTP client on users and keeps the library focused on state management, not networking.

**WebSocket or Server-Sent Events**

Real-time data streaming has different characteristics than request-response APIs. WebSockets and SSE require different abstractions and would significantly complicate the API. These might be considered for future versions but are out of scope for version one.

---

## 10. Technical Requirements and Constraints

### Development Environment

The library must support recent stable versions of Dart and Flutter to leverage modern language features while maintaining compatibility with most existing applications. Supporting very old versions would prevent using newer language features that make the implementation simpler and safer.

The minimum Dart version should be chosen to enable features like null safety, enhanced enum syntax, and sealed classes. The minimum Flutter version should support the widget lifecycle hooks needed for proper subscription management.

### Platform Support

The library must work identically across all Flutter platforms: iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop. This requires avoiding platform-specific APIs in the core and providing abstractions when platform differences are unavoidable.

Testing on all platforms is essential because subtle differences in timing, threading, and lifecycle can cause platform-specific bugs. Continuous integration must run the full test suite on all supported platforms to catch these issues before release.

### Performance Constraints

The library must not add noticeable latency to application operations. Cache access must be fast enough that it's not perceptible to users. Query subscriptions and state updates must not cause frame drops.

Specific performance targets provide concrete goals to optimize toward. Cache access should complete in under five milliseconds at the ninety-fifth percentile. Memory footprint should remain under ten megabytes for a thousand cached queries. The library should add less than fifty milliseconds to cold start time.

### Testing Requirements

Production readiness requires comprehensive testing at all levels. Unit tests verify individual functions and classes. Integration tests verify that components work together correctly. Widget tests verify UI integration. End-to-end tests verify complete workflows.

Memory leak testing is particularly important. Automated tests should run for extended periods while monitoring memory usage to detect leaks that only appear after prolonged use. Concurrency testing should simulate hundreds of simultaneous operations to find race conditions.

Test coverage should exceed eighty-five percent, with critical paths like cache management and error handling approaching one hundred percent coverage. Code that isn't tested can't be trusted in production.

### Quality Assurance

Code quality is maintained through automated tooling and manual review. Static analysis with strict lints catches common mistakes. Code review ensures that all changes are examined by multiple developers before merging.

The package must achieve high pub points, indicating that it follows Flutter best practices for package structure, documentation, and testing. The goal is maximum pub points to ensure the package meets community standards.

Documentation quality is as important as code quality. Every public API must have comprehensive documentation including parameter descriptions, return values, and examples. Complex features need dedicated guides that explain concepts and show complete working examples.

## 11. Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Memory Leaks in Production Applications**

Memory leaks are one of the highest-impact technical risks because they're hard to detect during development but cause serious problems in production. A slow memory leak can make an application progressively slower over hours or days until it crashes.

Mitigation requires comprehensive leak testing during development. Automated tests should run for extended periods while monitoring memory usage. DevTools memory profiling should be used to verify that queries and cache entries are properly disposed. The architecture should favor automatic cleanup through reference counting rather than requiring manual cleanup that developers might forget.

**Performance Degradation at Scale**

As the number of cached queries grows, operations that iterate the entire cache become expensive. A naive implementation might have acceptable performance with ten queries but become unusably slow with a thousand.

Mitigation requires profiling with realistic data volumes. Performance tests should simulate applications with thousands of queries to identify scalability issues. Data structures should be chosen based on their performance characteristics at scale. Operations that would require full cache iteration should be optimized or eliminated.

**Race Conditions in Cache Access**

Concurrent access to shared cache state can cause race conditions where data is corrupted or lost. These bugs are notoriously difficult to reproduce and debug because they depend on subtle timing differences.

Mitigation requires thread-safe data structures and careful synchronization. Every cache access must be protected by appropriate locks. Concurrency tests should aggressively exercise the cache with simultaneous access from many queries. The architecture should minimize shared mutable state to reduce the surface area for race conditions.

**State Synchronization Bugs**

Keeping query state synchronized with cache state and UI state is complex. Bugs in this synchronization can cause the UI to show stale data or not update when it should.

Mitigation requires a clear state machine that defines all possible states and transitions. Integration tests should verify that state transitions happen correctly for all code paths. The implementation should favor simple, predictable update patterns over complex optimizations that might introduce subtle bugs.

**API Breaking Changes**

Changes that break existing code force users to do migration work and create frustration. Too many breaking changes cause users to abandon the library.

Mitigation requires careful API design upfront, semantic versioning strictly enforced, and long deprecation periods. Before releasing version one, the API should be thoroughly reviewed to identify potential future problems. Once released, breaking changes should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and when they are necessary, migration guides and automated migration tools should be provided.

### Production Risks

**Crashes in Production Applications**

Unhandled exceptions or invalid state can crash applications using the library. Even a low crash rate is unacceptable because users lose trust in applications that crash.

Mitigation requires comprehensive error handling throughout the library. Every error should be caught and handled appropriately, either by recovering gracefully or providing a clear error to the application. Beta testing in real applications helps catch crashes that don't appear in artificial test scenarios.

**Battery Drain from Background Activity**

Aggressive polling or background sync can drain device batteries, leading users to uninstall the application.

Mitigation requires careful defaults for polling intervals and background behavior. The library should pause queries when the application is backgrounded unless explicitly configured otherwise. Battery usage should be monitored during testing on real devices to verify acceptable behavior.

**Network Request Storms**

Bugs in retry logic or cache invalidation could cause the library to make hundreds of simultaneous network requests, overwhelming the client and server.

Mitigation requires limits on concurrent requests, exponential backoff for retries, and circuit breakers that stop making requests to failing endpoints. Testing should include scenarios where the backend is slow or failing to verify that the library doesn't make the situation worse.

**Offline Data Loss**

Users expect that actions they take while offline will eventually sync to the server. Losing these actions causes frustration and data loss.

Mitigation requires persistent offline queues that survive app termination and background eviction. The implementation should be conservative about clearing queued mutations and provide user feedback when mutations are pending. Testing should verify that queued mutations actually sync after app restart.

### Adoption Risks

**Low Community Adoption**

If developers don't adopt the library, it won't gain the community momentum needed for long-term sustainability. Low adoption makes it harder to justify continued maintenance and improvement.

Mitigation requires strong marketing, excellent documentation, and active community engagement. The library needs to be showcased at conferences, written about in blog posts, and demonstrated in video tutorials. Early adopters should be supported exceptionally well to create positive word of mouth.

**Competition from Alternative Solutions**

Other libraries might solve the same problems in ways that developers prefer. Competition from well-marketed alternatives could prevent adoption.

Mitigation requires being genuinely better than alternatives, not just different. The library should solve real problems that developers face, provide exceptional documentation, and offer superior developer experience. Rather than competing on features, compete on reliability, performance, and ease of use.

### Operational Risks

**Maintenance Burden**

Open source maintenance is time-consuming. Issues, pull requests, questions, and documentation all require ongoing attention. Without sufficient maintainer capacity, quality degrades and community frustration grows.

Mitigation requires building a team of maintainers from the start, rather than relying on a single person. Clear contribution guidelines and automated workflows reduce the work required to review and merge contributions. Community moderators can help triage issues and answer questions, reducing the burden on core maintainers.

**Documentation Drift**

As the library evolves, documentation can become outdated if not actively maintained. Outdated documentation causes confusion and frustration.

Mitigation requires treating documentation as code that's maintained alongside the implementation. Documentation changes should be part of the same pull requests that change behavior. Automated tools should verify that code examples in documentation actually compile and work. Regular audits should catch documentation that doesn't match current behavior.

## 12. Timeline and Milestones

### Months One Through Three

The first three months focus on building and hardening the core package. This is the most critical phase because everything else depends on having a solid foundation.

Week one through three involves implementing the basic query infrastructure including the Query class, cache management, and state streams. This includes getting the happy path working where queries are created, data is fetched and cached, and subsequent requests are served from the cache.

Week four focuses on security features including secure cache entries, sensitive data handling, and integration with platform secure storage. This also includes implementing the circuit breaker pattern for handling failing endpoints.

Week five involves building the first adapter, which serves as both a proof of concept and a reference implementation. The Hooks adapter is chosen first because it has the simplest lifecycle management.

Weeks six and seven add the Bloc and Riverpod adapters. These validate that the core is truly state-management-agnostic and that the adapter pattern works for different state management philosophies.

Weeks eight through ten implement advanced features including infinite queries, dependent queries, and optimistic updates. These features are complex and require careful design to avoid introducing fragility.

Weeks eleven and twelve focus on developer experience including DevTools integration and testing utilities. This also includes comprehensive documentation and example applications.

Weeks thirteen and fourteen are for polish, optimization, and production validation. This includes beta testing in real applications, fixing any issues that appear, and performance optimization based on profiling results.

### Month Four: Release Candidate

Month four is dedicated to preparing for the stable release. The release candidate is published and promoted for community testing. Feedback is actively solicited through surveys, interviews, and monitoring of community discussions.

A professional security audit is conducted to verify that security-sensitive features like encrypted persistence and secure cache handling actually provide the promised protections. Any findings are addressed before the stable release.

Performance benchmarks are published comparing the library to hand-rolled solutions and other alternatives. This provides objective data about the performance characteristics developers can expect.

Documentation is finalized and reviewed for completeness and accuracy. Every feature should have clear documentation with examples. Common questions should be addressed in guides and FAQs.

### Months Five and Six: Post-Launch

After the stable release, the focus shifts to supporting the community and growing adoption. Quick hotfixes address any critical issues that appear in production usage. Non-critical bugs are triaged and scheduled for future releases.

Video tutorials are produced showing common workflows like setting up queries, handling errors, implementing infinite scroll, and optimistic updates. These videos should be concise and focused on practical problems developers face.

Conference talks and blog posts promote the library and educate developers about server state management concepts. This increases visibility and establishes the library as the standard solution.

Community adapter development is encouraged and supported. Adapters for GetX, Provider, and other state management solutions can be built by the community, expanding the library's reach.

## 13. Open Questions and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions Requiring Resolution

**Persistence Strategy**

The library needs to support optional persistence of cached data across app restarts. The question is whether to use Hive for performance, SharedPreferences for simplicity, or a pluggable interface that supports both.

Hive provides better performance and type safety but adds a dependency. SharedPreferences is built into Flutter but has limitations on data size and type support. A pluggable interface provides maximum flexibility but requires more implementation work and a more complex API.

The decision impacts the user experience, performance characteristics, and implementation complexity. It needs careful consideration of the trade-offs and validation through prototyping.

**Default Cache Size and Eviction**

Applications have widely varying data characteristics. A news app might cache thousands of small articles. A photo app might cache hundreds of large images. The default cache size needs to work reasonably well for both extremes.

Setting the default too low causes excessive eviction and refetching. Setting it too high risks out-of-memory errors on low-end devices. The eviction policy also matters: LRU works well when users repeatedly access the same data, but LFU might be better for workloads with occasional hot items.

This requires benchmarking with realistic applications to understand typical cache usage patterns and identify sensible defaults that work across different application types.

**Request Cancellation Behavior**

When a query is cancelled mid-flight, there are several possible behaviors. The request can be immediately aborted, wasting any partial response already received. The request can complete in the background and update the cache even though no one is waiting. The request can be tracked and reused if another subscriber appears.

Each approach has trade-offs between wasted work and code complexity. The right answer might be different for different use cases, suggesting the need for configurable behavior.

### Feature Scope Questions

**Offline Queue Limits**

The offline mutation queue can't grow without bounds or it will consume all available storage. But determining appropriate limits is challenging because different applications have different mutation patterns.

Should there be a limit on the number of queued mutations, the total size of queued data, or the age of queued mutations? Should old mutations be dropped, or should new mutations be rejected when the queue is full? Should the limits be configurable per mutation or globally?

These questions impact the reliability of offline functionality and need careful consideration of real-world usage patterns.

**Background Sync on iOS**

iOS has strict limitations on background execution. Applications get limited background time and can be terminated at any time. This makes reliable background sync challenging.

The library could queue mutations and rely on the user returning to foreground to sync. It could request background execution time when mutations are pending. It could integrate with background fetch APIs for periodic sync. Each approach has reliability and battery usage implications.

Understanding iOS limitations and designing around them is critical for applications where offline functionality is essential.

### Developer Experience Decisions

**DevTools Integration Approach**

The DevTools extension could be standalone or integrate with Flutter DevTools. A standalone extension is simpler to develop and deploy but requires developers to use a separate tool. Integration with Flutter DevTools provides a unified experience but is more complex and dependent on Flutter DevTools APIs.

There are also privacy and security considerations. DevTools showing sensitive cached data could be a security risk in some environments. The extension needs careful design to avoid exposing sensitive information.

**Testing Utilities Scope**

Testing utilities make the library easier to test, but determining the right scope is challenging. Should utilities mock individual queries, entire clients, or the network layer? Should they provide time manipulation, simulated network conditions, or both?

Comprehensive testing utilities make user code easier to test but increase the maintenance burden of the library. Finding the right balance requires understanding how developers actually test code that uses queries.

## 14. Success Criteria and Validation

### Technical Excellence Validation

Success on the technical dimension means the library is fast, reliable, and well-tested enough to be trusted in production applications. This is validated through objective metrics and rigorous testing.

Performance targets provide concrete goals. Cache operations completing in under five milliseconds at the ninety-fifth percentile ensures the library doesn't add noticeable latency. Memory footprint under ten megabytes for a thousand queries ensures the library scales to large applications without excessive memory usage.

Reliability is validated through stress testing where the library runs continuously for extended periods under heavy load. Zero memory leaks in twenty-four hours of operation demonstrates that resources are properly managed. Zero critical bugs in the first month after release indicates that the implementation is solid.

Test coverage exceeding eighty-five percent ensures that the vast majority of code is exercised by tests. This doesn't guarantee absence of bugs but significantly reduces the likelihood of serious issues in production.

### Developer Experience Validation

Developer experience is harder to measure objectively but equally important for success. It's evaluated through both quantitative and qualitative methods.

Time to first query measures how quickly a new developer can get from zero to having a working query. Under five minutes suggests the API is intuitive and well-documented. Documentation completeness is measured by checking that every public API has comprehensive documentation with examples.

Community satisfaction is assessed through surveys, reviews, and sentiment analysis of community discussions. A score above four point five out of five suggests developers find the library valuable and enjoyable to use.

The quality of questions in community forums also indicates developer experience. If developers are asking about advanced use cases, the basics are well-understood. If they're constantly asking how to do basic things, the API or documentation needs improvement.

### Production Readiness Validation

The ultimate test is real production applications successfully using the library. Beta testing with multiple applications exposes issues that don't appear in controlled testing environments.

Applications with large user bases provide particularly valuable validation. If an application with over one hundred thousand users deploys the library without issues, it demonstrates production readiness at scale.

Battery usage and performance monitoring in production applications validates that the library behaves well in real-world conditions. Crash rate analysis shows whether the library introduces stability issues.

### Adoption Metrics

Adoption is measured through package downloads, GitHub stars, and most importantly, real applications in production. Download counts can be misleading because they include CI/CD systems and don't indicate actual usage, but they provide a rough signal of interest.

Production applications are the most meaningful metric. Each production application represents developers who evaluated the library, found it valuable, and trusted it enough to ship it to users. Reaching ten production applications by six months validates that the library solves real problems.

Community health is assessed through contributor activity, discussion volume, and sentiment. An active community with regular contributions suggests the library has momentum and will continue improving.

### Failure Indicators

Knowing when the project is failing is as important as knowing when it's succeeding. Technical failure indicators include crash rates exceeding acceptable thresholds, memory leaks appearing in production, or performance significantly worse than hand-rolled solutions.

Adoption failure is indicated by stagnant downloads, lack of production usage, or negative community feedback. If developers try the library but don't deploy it to production, something isn't meeting their needs.

Operational failure shows up as growing issue backlogs, slow response times, or documentation becoming outdated. These indicate insufficient maintainer capacity or poor process.

## 15. Appendix and References

### Inspiration and Prior Art

This library draws heavily from React Query and SWR, which have proven the server state management pattern in the React ecosystem. Their API designs, mental models, and feature sets provide a foundation to build upon while adapting for Flutter's unique characteristics.

Flutter's widget lifecycle, state management diversity, and platform requirements differ from React's environment. The library takes the proven concepts and adapts them thoughtfully rather than directly copying APIs that wouldn't feel natural in Flutter.

### Competitive Landscape

The Flutter ecosystem has several state management solutions, but none focuses specifically on server state with the comprehensiveness of React Query. Riverpod, Bloc, and GetX all handle server state as a secondary concern, using the same patterns they use for client state.

This library differentiates by treating server state as fundamentally different and optimizing the entire design for that specific use case. Features like automatic caching, request deduplication, and background sync are first-class concerns rather than afterthoughts.

### Technical References

The implementation draws on established patterns for cache management, concurrency control, and error handling. Understanding LRU and LFU eviction policies, exponential backoff strategies, circuit breaker patterns, and optimistic update semantics informs the design decisions.

Platform-specific considerations come from Flutter's documentation on app lifecycle, memory management, and platform channels. Understanding iOS background execution limits, Android power management, and web service worker APIs ensures the library works correctly across all supported platforms.
