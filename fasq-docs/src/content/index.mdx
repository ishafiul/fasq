# Introduction

**Fasq** (Flutter Async State Query) is a powerful, developer-friendly state management solution for asynchronous data in Flutter. It handles fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in your application with zero boilerplate.

## Why Fasq?

Managing server state in Flutter can be challenging. You often need to:
- Show loading spinners while fetching data
- Handle errors gracefully
- Cache data to save bandwidth and improve performance
- Update UI instantly when data changes
- Refresh data in the background

**Fasq** handles all of this for you with a simple, widget-based API that feels native to Flutter.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Caching**: Data is cached automatically. Navigation back to a screen shows data instantly.
- **Background Refetching**: Stale data is shown immediately while fresh data is fetched in the background.
- **Request Deduplication**: Multiple widgets asking for the same data? Only one network request is made.
- **Window Focus Refetching**: Automatically refetch data when the app comes back to the foreground.
- **Optimisitc Updates**: Update your UI immediately when performing mutations, then sync with the server.
- **Infinite Queries**: Built-in support for infinite scrolling lists.
- **Offline Support**: Queue mutations when offline and sync when online.

## Installation

Add `fasq` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq: ^0.3.7
```

## Quick Example

Fasq is designed to work out of the box with `QueryBuilder`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:fasq/fasq.dart';

class TodoList extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return QueryBuilder<List<Todo>>(
      queryKey: 'todos'.toQueryKey(), 
      queryFn: () => api.fetchTodos(),
      builder: (context, state) {
        if (state.isLoading) {
          return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
        }

        if (state.hasError) {
          return Center(child: Text('Error: ${state.error}'));
        }

        if (state.hasData) {
          return ListView.builder(
            itemCount: state.data!.length,
            itemBuilder: (context, index) {
              final todo = state.data![index];
              return ListTile(title: Text(todo.title));
            },
          );
        }

        return const SizedBox();
      },
    );
  }
}
```
