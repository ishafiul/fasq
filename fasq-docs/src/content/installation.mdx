# Installation

Add Fasq to your Flutter project. You can use the core package alone or add adapters for your preferred state management solution.

## Core Package

The core package provides the `QueryBuilder` widget and all underlying functionality.

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq: ^0.3.7
```

## Adapters (Optional)

If you are already using one of these state management libraries, you can use the corresponding adapter for a more integrated experience.

### Hooks Adapter (flutter_hooks)

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_hooks: ^0.2.4+1
  flutter_hooks: ^0.20.0
```

### Bloc Adapter (flutter_bloc)

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_bloc: ^0.2.4+1
  flutter_bloc: ^8.1.0
```

### Riverpod Adapter (flutter_riverpod)

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_riverpod: ^0.2.4+1
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.0
```

## Security Plugin

For encrypted storage and secure caching:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_security: ^0.1.4
```

## Code Generation (Optional)

If you want to use the serializer generator:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.0
  fasq_serializer_generator: ^0.1.1
```

## Installation Steps

1. **Add dependencies** to your `pubspec.yaml`
2. **Run** `flutter pub get`
3. **Import** the packages you need:

// Core package
import 'package:fasq/fasq.dart';

// Adapters (if using)
// import 'package:fasq_hooks/fasq_hooks.dart';
// import 'package:fasq_bloc/fasq_bloc.dart';
// import 'package:fasq_riverpod/fasq_riverpod.dart';
```
