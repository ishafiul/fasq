# Installation

Add Fasq to your Flutter project. Choose the packages that match your state management approach.

## Core Package

The core package provides the `QueryBuilder` widget and all underlying functionality.

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq: ^0.1.0
```

## State Management Adapters

Choose one or more adapters based on your state management solution:

### Hooks Adapter

For apps using `flutter_hooks`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_hooks: ^0.1.0
  flutter_hooks: ^0.20.0
```

### Bloc Adapter

For apps using `flutter_bloc`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_bloc: ^0.1.0
  flutter_bloc: ^8.0.0
```

### Riverpod Adapter

For apps using `flutter_riverpod`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  fasq_riverpod: ^0.1.0

```

## Complete Example

Here's a typical `pubspec.yaml` for a project using multiple adapters:

```yaml
name: my_app
description: A Flutter app using Fasq

  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  
  # Core Fasq package
  fasq: ^0.1.0
  
  # Choose your state management adapters
  fasq_hooks: ^0.1.0
  fasq_bloc: ^0.1.0
  fasq_riverpod: ^0.1.0
  
  # State management dependencies
  flutter_hooks: ^0.20.0
  flutter_bloc: ^8.0.0
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.0.0

  http: ^1.1.0
  dio: ^5.0.0

dev_dependencies:
